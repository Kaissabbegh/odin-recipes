        <br>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <br>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <br>
        <li>¼ cup chopped marinated artichoke hearts</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <br>
        <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <br>
        <li>⅓ cup Chardonnay wine</li>
        <br>
        <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 ounces shredded aged Cheddar cheese
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot with water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and reserve pasta water. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine tapioca starch, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet until it shimmers. Add chicken pieces and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. You might be tempted to add more olive oil or butter, don't do this.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour in reserved pasta water and add mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix in white wine, cream and Cheddar cheese. Whisk until sauce is slightly thickened. Add rigatoni and toss to combine. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Add rigatoni and toss to combine. Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
